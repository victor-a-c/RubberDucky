# XMR miners
***

These scripts provide easy and fast setup for Monero mining.

Mining through web browsers despite not being very efficient is still possible and easy, the scripts that focus on web browser miners use MoneroOcean which sadly does not allow for full automatization since "TAB" is not able to select the button responsible for start mining.

Mining using XMRig and other miners might require Twin-Duck Firmware to be installed on MalDuino/Usb Rubber Ducky/Bad USB so that it would not need to download, Windows Defender has to be disabled first since it removes XMRig
